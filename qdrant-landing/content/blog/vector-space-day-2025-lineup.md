# Announcing the Vector Space Day 2025 Speaker Lineup

We are just days away from [Vector Space Day](https://luma.com/p7w9uqtz) in Berlin, and the full speaker lineup is here\! This yearâ€™s program spans keynotes, deep-dive technical sessions, and lightning talks, covering everything from benchmarking search engines to scalable AI memory and multimodal embeddings. Hereâ€™s what to expect.

## Opening Keynotes

The day begins with perspectives from across the ecosystem:

* **Andre Zayarni, Andrey Vasnetsov,** and **Neil Kanungo** sharing Qdrantâ€™s vision for the future of vector search and how devs can engage with the Qdrant Community.  
* **Robert Eichenseer (Microsoft), Kevin Cochrane (Vultr),** and **Inaam Syed (AWS)** offering insights on how cloud, infrastructure, and developer communities are reshaping AI systems.

## Breakout Sessions

#### Track A: Milky Way \- Architectures, Infrastructure and Multimodal Retrieval

* **AskNews** \- *Building a News Sleuth for the Deep Research Paradigm:* How high-performance hybrid retrieval can support investigative journalism and geopolitical risk monitoring.  
* **Delivery Hero** \- *How to Cheat at Benchmarking Search Engines:* Lessons from building reproducible benchmarking harnesses and public leaderboards.  
* **Neo4j** \- *Hands-On GraphRAG:* Practical guidance on combining knowledge graphs with RAG for more explainable retrieval.  
* **Superlinked** \- *Beyond Text-Only:* How mixture of encoders unlocks advanced retrieval using Google DeepMindâ€™s latest embeddings.  
* **Jina AI** \- *Vision-Language Models for Embedding:* Training insights for multimodal embeddings that span text, diagrams, and UI screenshots.  
* **TwelveLabs** \- *Practical Multimodal Embeddings:* Real workflows for cross-modal video search and recommendations.  
* **Baseten** \- *High Throughput, Low Latency Embedding Pipelines:* Patterns and open-source tools for production-ready embedding inference.  
* **Google** **DeepMind** \- *Vector Search with Gemini and EmbeddingGemma:* Deploying cutting-edge embeddings with the right indexing strategies.

#### Track B: Andromeda \- AI Workflows, Agents and Applications

* **Linkup** \- *Beyond Web Search:* Infrastructure for AI-native agents that need structured, real-time web intelligence.  
* **Cognee** \- *Building Scalable AI Memory:* Abstractions that sync graphs and vectors for durable, multi-backend AI memory.  
* **n8n** \- *Evaluate Your Qdrant-RAG Agents:* A live no-code session on agent evaluation using n8nâ€™s native tools.  
* **Arize AI** \- *Self-Improving Evaluations:* Feedback loops and tracing for reliable agentic RAG in production.  
* **LlamaIndex** \- *Vector Databases for Workflow Engineering:* Using Qdrant to orchestrate context-aware AI pipelines.  
* **deepset** \- *Agent-Powered Retrieval with Haystack and Qdrant:* When retrieval agents outperform or overcomplicate pipelines.  
* **GoodData** \- *Scaling Real-Time RAG for Analytics:* Lessons from streaming BI artifacts into Qdrant for natural-language analytics.  
* **Equal** \- *Redefining Long-Term Memory:* Streaming-driven ingestion architectures that give agents enterprise-grade responsiveness.

## Lightning Talks

The afternoon features rapid-fire sessions from innovators including:

* **bakdata** \- Streaming pipelines with Kafka and Qdrant.  
* **KI Reply** \- GDPR-compliant retrieval with graph-augmented RAG.  
* **iCompetence** \- Personalized product discovery with multimodal vectors.  
* **Raiva** **Technologies** \- Voice-first multimodal search with Qdrant.
