## **Qdrant is now available in the new AWS Marketplace AI Agents and Tools category.**

Customers can now use AWS Marketplace to easily discover, buy, and deploy AI agents solutions, including Qdrant’s vector search engine using their AWS accounts, accelerating AI agent and agentic workflow development.

Qdrant helps organizations build enterprise AI agents with long-term memory and real-time context retrieval by enabling step-aware reasoning and reliable decision-making across complex, unstructured data with a vector-native search engine built for accuracy, scale, and responsiveness.

"By offering Qdrant Cloud and Qdrant Hybrid Cloud (for private deployments) through the AWS Marketplace AI Agents and Tools category, we're providing customers with a streamlined way to access our native high-performance vector search engine \- critical to AI agents, helping them buy and deploy AI agent solutions faster and more efficiently." André Zayarni, co-founder and CEO at Qdrant. "Our customers — from AI-native startups to global enterprises and digital-native platforms — are already using Qdrant to power AI agents in production across healthcare, e-commerce, media, analytics, and more, to reduce agent failure, accelerate agentic RAG pipelines, and enable real-time, context-rich reasoning, demonstrating the real-world value of AI-native vector search."

Qdrant delivers essential capabilities including real-time metadata-aware retrieval at scale, hybrid search combining dense vectors, keywords, and filters, and native support for multivector embeddings for fine-grained context With the addition of [Qdrant Cloud Inference](https://qdrant.tech/cloud-inference/), customers can now generate and index embeddings directly inside their Qdrant Cloud clusters, eliminating external preprocessing and accelerating agent responsiveness. These features enable customers to equip agents with step-aware semantic memory, ensure grounded responses, and keep context fresh with real-time indexing at scale.

With the availability of AI Agents and Tools in AWS Marketplace, customers can significantly accelerate their procurement process to drive AI innovation, reducing the time needed for vendor evaluations and complex negotiations. With centralized purchasing using AWS accounts, customers maintain visibility and control over licensing, payments, and access through AWS.

Available as a fully managed SaaS and Hybrid Cloud deployment options, for private AWS deployments, Qdrant brings vector search close to where agents operate. This ensures seamless integration into AWS environments while meeting the low-latency, compliance, and scalability needs of production-grade agentic AI.
