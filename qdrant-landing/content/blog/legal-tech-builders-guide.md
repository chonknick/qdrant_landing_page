## LegalTech Builder's Guide: Navigating Strategic Decisions with Vector Search

### LegalTech is AI on hard-mode

LegalTech applications, more than most other application types, demand accuracy due to complex document structures, high regulatory stakes, and compliance requirements. Traditional keyword searches often fall short, failing to grasp semantic nuances essential for precise legal queries. [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) addresses these challenges by providing robust vector search solutions tailored for the complexities inherent in LegalTech applications.

### Getting Started: Choosing Your Search Infrastructure

#### Deployment Flexibility

Qdrant supports flexible deployment strategies, including [managed cloud](https://qdrant.tech/cloud/) and [hybrid cloud](https://qdrant.tech/hybrid-cloud/), along with open-source solutions via [Docker](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/quick-start/), enabling easy scaling and secure management of legal data.

#### Support and Ease of Use

We’re very responsive on our [Qdrant Discord channel](https://qdrant.tech/community/), have a free [Qdrant Cloud tier](https://cloud.qdrant.io/signup), are committed to open-source, and have great [documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/). Also, check out embedding workflows via our [FastEmbed integration](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/fastembed/) to simplify the inference process. 

#### Exploratory & Interactive Development

The [Qdrant Web UI](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/web-ui/) provides interactive experimentation, HTTP-based calls, and visual debugging, semantic similarity visualizations, and facilitating rapid prototyping.

### Achieving High Accuracy

When high accuracy at scale is paramount, the following Qdrant features can help reach the application’s performance goals.

#### Filterable Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)

[Filterable HNSW](https://qdrant.tech/articles/vector-search-filtering/) indexing improves speed, precision, and cost efficiency. The filterable vector index is Qdrant’s solves pre and post-filtering problems by adding specialized links to the search graph. It maintains speed advantages of vector search while allowing for precise filtering, addressing the inefficiencies that can occur when applying filters after the vector search. The [Garden Intel case study](https://qdrant.tech/case-studies/) exemplifies how its used in practice for a LegalTech use case.

#### Hybrid Search: Semantic \+ Keyword

Hybrid search effectively combines semantic vector search with precise keyword matching, ideal for legal documents where exact citations and nuanced conceptual similarities coexist. [Minicoil](https://qdrant.tech/articles/minicoil/), a sparse neural retriever, enriches lexical accuracy by understanding contextual token meanings. For instance, [Aracor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/case-study-aracor/) leverages hybrid search to precisely retrieve relevant clauses across extensive legal document repositories. Below is a pseudocode example:

```json
POST /collections/{collection_name}/points/query
{
  "prefetch": {
    "query": [0.2, 0.8, ...],
    "limit": 50
  },
  "query": {
    "formula": {
      "sum": [
        "$score",
        {
          "mult": [
            0.5,
            {
              "key": "tag",
              "match": { "any": ["h1", "h2", "h3", "h4"] }
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "mult": [
            0.25,
            {
              "key": "tag",
              "match": { "any": ["p", "li"] }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Leveraging Late-Interaction Models for Rich Documents

Advanced multimodal models ([ColPali](https://qdrant.tech/blog/qdrant-colpali/) and ColQwen) bypass traditional OCR pipelines, directly processing images of complex documents. They enhance accuracy by maintaining original layouts and contextual integrity, simplifying your retrieval pipelines. The tradeoff is a heavier application, but these challenges can be addressed with further [optimization](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/guides/optimize/)*.*

#### Precision Reranking: Multivector Models

Utilize [ColBERT](https://qdrant.tech/articles/late-interaction-models/) for high-accuracy reranking, allowing highly granular, token-level similarity estimation with high accuracy results, which is critical for nuanced legal searches. It is also faster than traditional cross-encoders for reranking. Since Qdrant supports multivectors natively, this is easy to integrate into your search application.  

```python
# Step 1: Retrieve hybrid results using dense and sparse queries
hybrid_results = client.search(
    collection_name="legal-hybrid-search",
    query_vector=dense_vector,
    query_sparse_vector=sparse_vector,
    limit=20,
    with_payload=True
)

# Step 2: Tokenize the query using ColBERT
colbert_query_tokens = colbert_model.query_tokenize(query_text)

# Step 3: Score and rerank results using ColBERT token-level scoring
reranked = sorted(
    hybrid_results,
    key=lambda doc: colbert_model.score(
        colbert_query_tokens,
        colbert_model.doc_tokenize(doc["payload"]["document"])
    ),
    reverse=True
)

# Step 4: Return top-k reranked results
final_results = reranked[:5]
```


#### Customizable Scoring with Score Boosting

Qdrant's [Score Boosting Reranker](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/hybrid-queries/#score-boosting) lets you integrate domain-specific logic (e.g., jurisdiction or recent cases) directly into search rankings, ensuring results align precisely with legal business rules.

```json
POST /collections/legal-docs/points/query
{
  "prefetch": {
    "query": [0.21, 0.77, ...], 
    "limit": 50
  },
  "query": {
    "formula": {
      "sum": [
        "$score",  // dense semantic match
        {
          "mult": [0.6, { "key": "section", "match": { "any": ["Clause", "Provision", "Section"] } }]
        },
        {
          "mult": [0.3, { "key": "heading", "match": { "any": ["Definitions", "Governing Law", "Termination"] } }]
        },
        {
          "mult": [0.1, { "key": "paragraph_type", "match": { "any": ["Interpretation", "Remedy"] } }]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Ensuring Scalability and High Performance

Scalability and performance become increasingly critical post-accuracy validation. Qdrant’s advanced capabilities address these needs effectively.

#### Efficient Indexing and Retrieval Techniques 

* [GPU indexing](https://qdrant.tech/blog/qdrant-1.13.x/) accelerates indexing by up to 10x compared to CPU methods, offering vendor-agnostic compatibility with modern GPUs via Vulkan API.

* [Vector quantization](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/guides/quantization/) compresses embeddings, significantly reducing memory and operational costs. It results in lower accuracy, so carefully consider this option. For example, [LawMe](http://qdrant.tech/blog/case-study-lawme), a Qdrant user, uses Binary Quantization to cost-effectively add more data for its AI Legal Assistants. 

#### Enterprise-Grade Capabilities

Qdrant’s enterprise-ready features, including RBAC, SSO, Database API Keys (down to the vector level), comprehensive monitoring, and observability, ensure secure, compliant, and manageable deployments at scale. 

Qdrant is also SOC II Type II and HIPAA compliant ([link](https://app.drata.com/trust/9cbbb75b-0c38-11ee-865f-029d78a187d9)).
