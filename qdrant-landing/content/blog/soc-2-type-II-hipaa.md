## Qdrant Attains SOC 2 Type II and HIPAA Certifications: Strengthening Our Commitment to Enterprise Security

At Qdrant, we're proud to announce that we've successfully renewed our SOC 2 Type II certification and attained our HIPAA compliance certification ([link](http://qdrant.to/trust-center)). This continued achievement highlights our unwavering dedication to maintaining robust security, confidentiality, and compliance standards, especially critical in supporting [enterprise-scale operations](https://qdrant.tech/enterprise-solutions/) and sensitive data management.

### SOC 2 Type II: Continuous Commitment to Security

Building on our initial SOC 2 Type II certification from 2024, Qdrant sustained our rigorous security and operational practices over a full 12-month observation period. SOC 2 Type II audits meticulously assess the practical implementation of security measures aligned with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Trust Services criteria:

* **Security**

* **Confidentiality**

* **Availability**

Our latest audit further demonstrates our ongoing commitment to uphold these stringent standards throughout our operations.

### Introducing HIPAA Compliance: Protecting Sensitive Healthcare Data

In addition to SOC 2 Type II, Qdrant now holds HIPAA compliance certification. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) certification is essential for healthcare organizations and those handling Protected Health Information (PHI). With this certification, Qdrant ensures that enterprises leveraging our platform can confidently manage sensitive healthcare data, adhering to stringent regulatory requirements.

### Empowering Enterprise Security with Advanced Features
