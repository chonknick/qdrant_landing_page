# Configuring Qdrant Operator: Advanced Options

The Qdrant Operator has several configuration options, which can be configured in the advanced section of your Hybrid Cloud Environment.

The following YAML shows all configuration options with their default values:

```yaml
# Additional pod annotations
podAnnotations: {}

tolerations: []

# Affinity configuration for the Qdrant operator
affinity: {}

# Configuration for the Qdrant operator (v2)
settings:
  # The log level for the operator
  # Available options: DEBUG | INFO | WARN | ERROR
