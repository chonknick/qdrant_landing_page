# About Qdrant Managed Cloud

Qdrant Managed Cloud is our SaaS (software-as-a-service) solution, providing managed Qdrant database clusters on the cloud. We provide you the same fast and reliable similarity search engine, but without the need to maintain your own infrastructure.

Transitioning to the Managed Cloud version of Qdrant does not change how you interact with the service. All you need is a [Qdrant Cloud account](https://qdrant.to/cloud/) and an [API key](/documentation/cloud/authentication/) for each request.

You can also attach your own infrastructure as a Hybrid Cloud Environment. For details, see our [Hybrid Cloud](/documentation/hybrid-cloud/) documentation.

## Cluster Configuration

Each database cluster comes pre-configured with the following features:

- Allows the creation of highly available clusters with automatic failover
- Easy version upgrades, zero-downtime on highly available clusters
- Monitoring, logging and alerting to observe the health of each cluster
- Horizontal and vertical up and down scaling
- Automatic shard rebalancing
- Support for resharding
- Backups and disaster recovery
- Available natively on AWS and GCP, and Azure.
- Available on your own infrastructure and other providers if you use the Hybrid Cloud
